Automate File Organization with Python: A Simple Script

1. Introduction:
Organizing files on your computer can be a tedious task, especially when dealing with large numbers of files. In this blog post, I’ll show you how to create a Python script that automates file organization based on specific keywords in filenames. This can save time and ensure that your files are always neatly sorted.





2. The Script:

I developed a Python script that moves files containing the keywords "JK," "JisuKim," or "Jisu Kim" from a source directory to an "application" folder. This script uses Python’s built-in os and shutil modules to handle file operations.



4. How It Works:
   
Setup Directories: Define the paths for your source and destination directories.
Check for Keywords: The script looks for filenames containing "JK," "JisuKim," or "Jisu Kim."
Move Files: It moves matching files to the "application" folder and prints a confirmation message.
Conclusion:
This script simplifies file management by automating the organization process based on specific keywords. It’s a practical tool for keeping your files sorted and can be easily customized for other file organization tasks.
